This project demonstrates the essential steps involved in building a basic NER system using an LSTM architecture. While the hardcoded dataset is a simplified example, real-world applications would require larger, annotated datasets to train more robust models. This project serves as a building block to implementing an auto tagging system in our project, PromptWiki:your one stop platform to discover,share and generate prompts!
